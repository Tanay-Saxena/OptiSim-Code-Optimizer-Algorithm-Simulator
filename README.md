# OptiSim-Code-Optimizer-Algorithm-Simulator

Designed and developed a dual-purpose Java-based tool for compiler optimization and algorithm visualization with an interactive GUI using JavaFX.

Built a compiler front-end to parse simplified C/Java code using ANTLR, generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG).

Implemented optimization passes including constant folding, dead code elimination, and code simplification, visualized step-by-step.

Developed an algorithm visualizer module that simulates popular DSA algorithms like:

Sorting: Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap

Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, Bellman-Ford, Topological Sort

Dynamic Programming: LCS, 0/1 Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication

Trees: BST operations, AVL rotations, traversals

Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Rat in a Maze

Integrated visual features like step-by-step simulation, complexity panels, pseudo-code synchronization, and variable state highlights.

Engineered the architecture with modular components: Parser Engine, Optimizer Core, Visualization Controller, and UI Layer.

Tools/Tech: Java Core, ANTLR, JavaFX, Scene Builder, Custom Animation Engine

Positioned as a powerful educational tool for learning both compiler concepts and DSA, with potential as an open-source teaching platform.
